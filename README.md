# OpenTeams Score

## Overview

OpenTeams Score is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate and categorize open source projects. 
It provides users with valuable insights to assess the suitability of open source dependencies for their projects.

The end product of this repo is a score dataset

## Features

- Dual-category scoring system: Maturity and Health & Risk
- Data export to BigQuery for easy access and analysis
- Open-source scraping scripts for transparency and collaboration

## Maturity Categories

### 1. Experimental 
- **Definition**: The project is in the initial phase of its development lifecycle. It is primarily aimed at early adopters and developers interested in the latest features or in contributing to the project's development.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Frequent Breaking Changes**: The API or core functionality may change often, requiring adjustments in dependent code with each update.
  - **Limited Documentation**: Documentation may be sparse or in flux, as features are rapidly evolving.
  - **Small User Base**: Typically has a smaller community of users and contributors, which can affect the speed of issue resolution and feature requests.
  - **Use Case**: Best suited for development and testing environments, or for research and exploration of new concepts.


2. Developing
3. Mature
4. Legacy

## Health & Risk Categories

1. Healthy
2. Caution Needed
3. High Risk

## Datasets:

### PyPI Packages

`gs://openteams-score/pypi.parquet`

Parquet Table columns:

* `source_location`: (primary ID) The URI of the source code 
* `name`: The name of the package
* `version`: the version


### Scores Result 

The Scores Result is a JSON object that provides detailed information about the evaluated open source project. This includes metadata about the project, the packages it contains, and the scores assigned to it based on maturity and health & risk categories.
